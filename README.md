# Technical-Documentation

## Overview

The Technical Documentation Page is a web-based documentation platform that provides information about key technical topics. It covers topics such as HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Responsive Design, APIs, and Version Control. The page is designed to be responsive and includes a navigation bar for easy access to different sections.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.

### HTML File (`index.html`)

The HTML file defines the structure of the technical documentation page. Key elements include:

- **Document Type Declaration:** Specifies the HTML5 document type.
- **HTML Element:** The root HTML element with the `lang` attribute set to "en."
- **Head Section:** Contains meta information, including character set, viewport settings, a link to the external CSS file (`styles.css`), and the title of the page.
- **Body Section:** Includes the main content of the page, such as the navigation bar (`#navbar`) and different sections (`#main-doc`) for each technical topic.

### CSS File (`styles.css`)

The CSS file provides styling for the technical documentation page, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout. Key styles include:

- **Body Styles:** Removes default margin and sets the font family.
- **Navbar Styles (`#navbar`):** Defines the appearance of the fixed-position navigation bar, including background color, text color, padding, and width.
- **Navbar Header Styles (`#navbar header`):** Sets the font size and margin for the header in the navigation bar.
- **Navbar Link Styles (`.nav-link`):** Defines the appearance of navigation links, including color, text decoration, and margin.
- **Main Section Styles (`.main-section`):** Adjusts the margin to accommodate the width of the navigation bar, sets padding, and box-sizing for the main content sections.
- **Media Query (`@media`):** Adjusts styles for smaller screens (max-width: 768px) by making the navigation bar width 100% and resetting the margin for the main content.

## Responsive Design

The Technical Documentation Page incorporates responsive design principles to ensure a positive user experience across various devices. The navigation bar adapts to smaller screens, making the page accessible and readable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Conclusion

The Technical Documentation Page serves as an informative resource for developers, covering essential technical topics. The use of HTML and CSS structures the content, while responsive design ensures accessibility on different devices. The documentation provides insights into the project's structure and styling, offering a comprehensive guide for users and developers alike.
